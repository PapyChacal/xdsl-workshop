    "\n",
    "The SSA form is enforced throughout the xDSL framework, as it is widely accepted as a powerful abstraction for compilers. By restricting all variables to single assignment, a lot of compilers problems become simpler, and this holds even more power in a composable and extensible framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"thing\" is, obviously, it doesn't change the underlying work to do, the targets to compile to, etc.. There is an obvious contradiction between this abstraction and a register machine for example, where we have a very limited amount of registers, and we *have to* reuse them for any real-world task. e.g, how would you use a stack without actually rewriting the stack pointer?\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, all of that is doable with xDSL, and would usually be done through a register allocation step, leading to a similar RISC-V representation, but directly mapping the assembly. The format would go from the current one :\n",
